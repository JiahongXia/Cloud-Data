# Cloud-Data
Stat 154 spring 2019 project 2
We first developed two different methods to split the data, and we put different methods in
different cells. You need to make sure you run the method cells correctly before you continue 
to the next part. Then we generic cross validation (CV) function CVgeneric in R that takes a generic classifier, training features, training labels, number of folds K and a loss function as inputs and outputs the K-fold CV loss on the training set.
